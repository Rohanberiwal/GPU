Level of Detail (LOD) 
LOD techniques are methods used in computer graphics to manage and optimize the level of detail displayed in a scene, particularly for 3D models or terrains. 
The basic idea is to adjust the complexity or detail of objects based on factors such as their distance from the viewer.
The goal is to allocate computational resources more efficiently, improving rendering performance while maintaining a visually pleasing and realistic representation.
Some of the example are  :

Distance-based Detail:
Objects or terrain features that are closer to the viewer are rendered with more detail.
Objects or terrain features that are farther away are rendered with less detail.

Benefits of LOD Techniques:

Performance Optimization: Rendering highly detailed models or terrains can be computationally expensive. 
By reducing detail for distant objects, LOD techniques help maintain a smooth and responsive frame rate.

Memory Efficiency: Storing and processing detailed geometry for the entire scene can be memory-intensive.
LOD allows for more efficient memory usage by loading and rendering only the necessary level of detail based on the viewer's perspective.
Types of LOD Techniques:


Geometric LOD: Involves changing the geometric representation of an object based on its distance. 
For example, using simpler 3D models or reducing the number of polygons in a model for distant views.


Texture LOD: Adjusts the level of detail in textures based on the viewer's distance. Distant objects might use lower-resolution textures to save memory and
improve rendering performance.

Mipmapping: A specific form of texture LOD where precomputed texture maps at different resolutions (mipmaps) are used based on the distance from the viewer.

Terrain LOD:
In the context of terrain rendering, LOD techniques are often crucial. For example, in geomipmapping, the terrain is divided into patches, 
and the level of detail of each patch is dynamically adjusted based on the viewer's position.
High-resolution terrain geometry is used for areas close to the viewer, while lower resolutions are used for more distant terrain.

Dynamic LOD:
LOD techniques can be dynamic, meaning they can adapt in real-time as the viewer moves through the scene.
This adaptability ensures that the most appropriate level of detail is used for each object based on the viewer's perspective.
