Voxels
Voxels short for volumetric pixels, are three-dimensional (3D) pixels that represent a point in space within a 3D grid.
Unlike traditional pixels in 2D images, which have two dimensions (width and height), voxels add a third dimension (depth).
Essentially, a voxel is the 3D counterpart of a 2D pixel.
In a 3D space, a voxel contains information about a specific point in the volume, such as color, opacity, 
or other attributes. Voxels are commonly used in medical imaging, scientific visualization, computer graphics, 
and other fields where three-dimensional data representation is essential.
One of the notable applications of voxels is in medical imaging, where they are employed to represent the elements of a
three-dimensional medical scan . In computer graphics and video games, voxels have been used in
voxel-based rendering techniques, where the entire scene is represented using volumetric data instead of traditional polygonal meshes.
Voxel-based approaches have advantages in certain situations, such as efficient representation of volumetric data and the ability 
to easily perform operations like slicing or cutting through the data in any direction. However,
they also come with computational challenges due to the increased data volume compared to traditional 2D pixel-based representations.
