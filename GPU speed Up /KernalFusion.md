# Kernel Fusion


Kernel fusion is a technique used in GPU programming to improve performance by combining multiple kernel functions into a single kernel. A kernel function in this context refers to a function that runs in parallel on individual threads of a GPU.

## Why Kernel Fusion?

When GPU kernels are launched sequentially, there is overhead associated with launching each kernel individually. This overhead includes setting up the kernel, transferring data to the GPU, and synchronizing between kernels. Kernel fusion aims to reduce this overhead by combining multiple operations into a single kernel, thereby reducing the number of kernel launches and associated overhead.

## Benefits of Kernel Fusion

- **Reduced Overhead**: By combining multiple operations into a single kernel, the overhead associated with kernel launches and data transfers is minimized, leading to improved performance.
  
- **Improved Memory Access Patterns**: Kernel fusion allows for better optimization of memory access patterns within the GPU, leading to reduced memory latency and improved memory throughput.

- **Simplified Code**: Combining multiple operations into a single kernel can result in cleaner and more maintainable code compared to having multiple separate kernels.

## Considerations

While kernel fusion can offer performance benefits, it's important to consider the trade-offs involved:

- **Increased Complexity**: Combining multiple operations into a single kernel can increase the complexity of the kernel code, potentially making it harder to understand and maintain.

- **Resource Limitations**: Combining too many operations into a single kernel can lead to resource limitations, such as exceeding the maximum number of threads or registers per block, which can negatively impact performance.

- **Balance between Fusion and Parallelism**: Kernel fusion should be balanced with the need for parallelism. Combining too many unrelated operations into a single kernel may limit the ability of the GPU to execute them efficiently in parallel.

## Example

```cuda
__global__ void fusedKernel(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        // Operation 1: A = A + B
        A[idx] += B[idx];

        // Operation 2: C = A * B
        C[idx] = A[idx] * B[idx];
    }
}
