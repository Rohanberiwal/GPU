## Key Differences:

1. **Architecture**:
   - **CPU**: General-purpose processor with fewer, high-performance cores.
   - **GPU**: Specialized processor with thousands of smaller, more efficient cores optimized for parallel computation.

2. **Parallelism**:
   - **CPU**: Suited for sequential tasks; less optimized for parallel computation.
   - **GPU**: Highly optimized for parallel tasks; excels at executing many threads simultaneously.

3. **Memory Hierarchy**:
   - **CPU**: Utilizes a hierarchy of caches and system memory (RAM).
   - **GPU**: Has dedicated VRAM optimized for parallel computation, often with larger capacities.

4. **Workload Types**:
   - **CPU**: Suitable for general computing tasks and tasks with complex control flow.
   - **GPU**: Well-suited for highly parallelizable tasks such as graphics rendering and scientific simulations.

5. **Programming Model**:
   - **CPU**: Uses a sequential programming model (e.g., C, C++, Python).
   - **GPU**: Utilizes a data-parallel programming model (e.g., CUDA, OpenCL) for writing parallel code.

6. **Energy Efficiency**:
   - **CPU**: Optimized for low-power operation and efficient handling of diverse tasks.
   - **GPU**: Optimized for high throughput and parallelism; may consume more power under heavy computational loads.
