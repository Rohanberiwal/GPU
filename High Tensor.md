# High Input Tensor Documentation

## Introduction
Briefly introduce the purpose and context of the high input tensor. Include its role in the neural network or application.

## Specifications

### Dimensions
- **Shape**: (batch_size, channels, height, width)
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples processed simultaneously.
- **Channels**: Number of feature channels in each input sample.
- **Height**: Height dimension of each input sample.
- **Width**: Width dimension of each input sample.

### Data Type
- **Data Type**: float32 (or specify the exact data type used)

### Range and Scale
Describe the typical range and scale of the input values. Include any normalization or preprocessing steps applied to the tensor.

### Input Requirements
Specify any specific requirements or constraints for the input tensor:
- Input size constraints.
- Input preprocessing steps.
- Expected data format.

## Usage

### Input Preparation
Describe how to prepare the input tensor before feeding it into the neural network or application.

### Integration
Provide examples or guidelines on integrating the high input tensor with other components of the system, such as data loaders or preprocessing pipelines.

## Example Code

```python
import torch

# Example high input tensor
batch_size = 4
channels = 3
height = 256
width = 256

input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, channels, height, width)

print("Shape of input tensor:", input_tensor.shape)
